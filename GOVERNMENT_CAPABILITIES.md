# MWRASP Government & Defense Capabilities

## Executive Summary for Government Decision Makers

MWRASP provides the first comprehensive post-quantum security solution specifically designed for AI agent operations in national security environments. Developed by a former Marine Force Reconnaissance operator with combat experience and diplomatic security background, MWRASP addresses critical gaps in AI authentication and quantum-resistant protection.
